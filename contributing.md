## LabVIEW Version

This project is implemented in LabVIEW 2015 in order to allow developers who are stuck on older versions of LabVIEW to still be able to use the QD shortcut. If possible, try to use LabVIEW 2015 to make contributions.

**If you do not have access to LabVIEW 2015:**  Feel free to still make pull requests using whatever version you have. Please make a note of the version you used in your pull request and try to only save the files you have actually changed. This makes it easier for me to know which files I'll need to backsave to 2015. I have turned on the "separate compiled code from source" option for all VIs, so this should help you to only save the ones you need to save.

## Timeline

I'm not always able to respond to pull requests and issues right away. However, I really appreciate all contributions and will eventually respond to all of them. Thank you for your help!
