In order to use the PaneRelief Quick Drop shortcut, copy the file called "PaneRelief.llb" in the "LLB" folder and place it in the following location:

C:\Program Files (x86)\National Instruments\LabVIEW XXXX\resource\dialog\QuickDrop\plugins

Replace "LabVIEW XXXX" with the version you are using, and use "Program Files" instead of "Program Files (x86)" if using 64-bit LabVIEW or a 32-bit OS.

Source code is written in LabVIEW 2018, but the LLB was backsaved to 2015 so it can be used in any LabVIEW version 2015 and higher.
