Use this tool to easily set properties of panes and splitters.

Open the package (.vip file) in VI Package Manager to install. Use the .vipb file to rebuild the package if you make changes to the source.

To use the tool, open Quick Drop by pressing ctl + space, then press ctl + a. The PaneRelief window will appear and show you a view of the panes and splitters on your current VI's front panel. Click a pane or splitter on the view to select it and then view and edit the properties at the bottom.

The source code is written in LabVIEW 2019, but it was backsaved to LabVIEW 2015 for the package.
